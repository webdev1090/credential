Hi Oleksandr,

Thank you for sending me an invite to apply for the job posting. I read the job description and would like to know what the work will involve.

To summarize my experience, I have worked on a startup using Django and have implemented a payment processing interface, have setup social media authorizations and used AWS 

for storing data. The work involved implementing new functionality and data migration from the old database to the new database. I also have experience scraping websites for 

specific data. I have done majority of the backend work and 30-40% of the front end work.

Looking forward to hearing from you.
Kristine

When you finish our contract, please leave me excellent feedback (5 stars, 10/10 recommendation and excellent comment)
I hope you will leave me excellent feedback(5 stars, 10/10 recommendation and excellent comment).
